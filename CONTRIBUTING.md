# Contributing to Venom

Venom welcomes focused changes that preserve its crate boundaries and authorized-security-testing purpose. By participating, you agree to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Development setup

Required: Git and Rust `1.88` or newer. Docker is optional for the local
container build and runtime contract; repository tests do not require database
or cache services.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ITherso/venom.git
cd venom
cargo test --workspace
```

The repository exposes common maintenance commands through `cargo xtask`:

```bash
cargo xtask docs
cargo xtask benchmark
cargo xtask architecture
cargo xtask release
cargo xtask generate scanner my-scanner
cargo xtask generate plugin my-plugin
```

The generate commands require `cargo-generate` (`cargo install cargo-generate`).

The root `Cargo.toml` is a virtual manifest. Do not create a root `src/`
directory; put Rust code in an existing workspace package or propose a package
boundary through an ADR. The architecture command enforces this rule.

## First contribution

Start with a scoped [`good first issue`](https://github.com/ITherso/venom/labels/good%20first%20issue). Comment before implementation, keep the first pull request to one observable outcome, and ask for scope clarification on the issue if an acceptance criterion is ambiguous.

Good first contributions usually add focused contract tests, correct an evidence-backed documentation gap, improve a generator example, or reduce a specific lint without changing architecture. New scan techniques, public API redesigns, and distributed execution changes need a design discussion first.

Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ITherso/venom/discussions) for usage questions, design proposals, and contributor help. Use Issues for reproducible bugs and accepted, scoped work. Never use either public channel for a vulnerability; follow the private reporting process below.

## Coding style

- Workspace crates forbid unsafe Rust. Do not add an `unsafe` block; any proposed exception requires an explicit lint-policy and architecture change before implementation.
- Keep dependencies directed toward `venom-core`; entry-point and product crates must not leak into lower layers.
- Keep runner, phase, plugin, event, report, and transport responsibilities separate.
- Use async I/O on runtime paths and never block a Tokio worker thread.
- Return structured errors and findings; do not hide failures in logging alone.
- Document public contracts with a compiling example when practical.

Before opening a pull request, run:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo xtask architecture
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-features
```

Formatting is defined by `rustfmt.toml`; lint behavior is defined by `clippy.toml` and CI. Do not hand-format around these tools.

## Branch naming

Use a short lowercase description:

- `feature/plugin-capabilities`
- `fix/event-ordering`
- `docs/scanner-sdk`
- `chore/dependency-policy`

Avoid personal names, ticket-only branch names, and broad branches such as `changes`.

## Commit style

Use an imperative Conventional Commit subject, optionally with a scope:

```text
feat(sdk): add custom scanner builder
fix(plugin): reject incompatible API versions
docs(adr): record event bus ownership
chore(ci): enforce the declared MSRV
```

Keep commits reviewable and do not mix refactors with unrelated behavior changes. Explain the reason and compatibility impact in the commit body when the subject is insufficient.

## Pull request checklist

- [ ] The change is focused and the description explains why it is needed.
- [ ] `cargo fmt`, Clippy, and relevant tests pass.
- [ ] New behavior has unit, integration, or doc-test coverage.
- [ ] Public API changes follow [the SemVer policy](docs/plugin-api-policy.md).
- [ ] Architecture changes update or add an [ADR](docs/adr/README.md).
- [ ] User-facing changes update documentation and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- [ ] New dependencies pass `cargo audit` and `cargo deny` policy.
- [ ] Security-testing examples use targets the contributor owns or is authorized to test.
- [ ] No secrets, credentials, private targets, or real customer data are included.

## Security reports

Do not open a public issue for a vulnerability. Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
