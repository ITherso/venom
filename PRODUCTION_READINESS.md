# Production Readiness Checklist

## Current Status: EXPERIMENTAL / BETA

VENOM v1.0.0 is **NOT** production-ready. This document outlines what is required before production deployment.

---

## ✅ What IS Stable

- ✅ **Core Architecture** — Modular design, 37 modules, 19,100+ lines
- ✅ **Test Coverage** — 573+ tests (100% passing), comprehensive
- ✅ **Code Quality** — Type-safe Rust, zero unsafe (except memmap2)
- ✅ **Async/Await** — Full async support via Tokio
- ✅ **Plugin System** — 6 built-in plugins + Lua scripting
- ✅ **API Gateway** — 4 rate-limiting algorithms
- ✅ **Compliance** — GDPR/HIPAA/SOC2/PCI-DSS support

## ⚠️ What Needs Work Before Production

### 1. Performance Validation (**CRITICAL**)

**Required:**
- [ ] Benchmark suite with baseline metrics (throughput, latency, memory)
- [ ] Load testing (100+ concurrent connections)
- [ ] Memory profiling under sustained load
- [ ] CPU profiling and optimization
- [ ] Disk I/O profiling with SQLite
- [ ] Network bandwidth analysis

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Throughput: >1000 requests/sec on single node
- Latency: p95 <500ms for typical scan
- Memory: <2GB for 100 concurrent scans
- CPU: <80% on 4-core system

**Current Status:** ❌ Not measured

---

### 2. Security Audit (**CRITICAL**)

**Required:**
- [ ] 3rd party security review
- [ ] Penetration testing against VENOM itself
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scan (`cargo audit`)
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 validation
- [ ] Cryptography review (TLS, key generation)
- [ ] Input validation testing

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Zero critical/high vulnerabilities
- All dependencies up-to-date
- Proper key rotation implemented
- Secure certificate generation

**Current Status:** ❌ Not audited

---

### 3. Resilience & Reliability (**HIGH PRIORITY**)

**Required:**
- [ ] Fuzz testing (cargo-fuzz)
- [ ] Chaos testing (network failures, timeouts)
- [ ] Recovery testing (graceful shutdown, restart)
- [ ] Database consistency testing
- [ ] Plugin failure handling
- [ ] Event bus stress testing

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Survives 10,000+ random inputs
- Recovers from network failures
- No data corruption after crash
- Plugins fail independently

**Current Status:** ❌ Not tested

---

### 4. Operational Readiness (**HIGH PRIORITY**)

**Required:**
- [ ] Docker/Kubernetes deployment guide
- [ ] Monitoring integration (Prometheus metrics)
- [ ] Logging aggregation (structured JSON logs)
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Graceful degradation
- [ ] Configuration validation
- [ ] Database migration system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Deployable via Docker
- Exportable metrics
- Structured logging
- Health check API

**Current Status:** ❌ Not implemented

---

### 5. Documentation (**MEDIUM PRIORITY**)

**Required:**
- [ ] Architecture documentation
- [ ] API specification (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Configuration reference
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Performance tuning guide
- [ ] Security hardening guide
- [ ] Contribution guidelines

**Current Status:** ⚠️ Partial (README only)

---

### 6. Compliance & Policy (**MEDIUM PRIORITY**)

**Required:**
- [ ] CVE disclosure policy
- [ ] Security incident response plan
- [ ] Data retention policy
- [ ] Audit log retention
- [ ] Privacy policy
- [ ] Terms of service
- [ ] License clarity

**Current Status:** ❌ Not documented

---

### 7. Feature Maturity (**LOW PRIORITY for core, HIGH for features**)

**Stable (use in production):**
- ✅ MITM Proxy
- ✅ Core scanning phases (1-6)
- ✅ Plugin system
- ✅ API gateway

**Beta (use with caution):**
- ⚠️ Distributed scaling (not load-tested)
- ⚠️ ML integration (research-quality)
- ⚠️ Advanced detection (WAF-specific)
- ⚠️ Threat intelligence (feed dependency)

**Experimental (research only):**
- 🔬 Lua scripting (new feature)
- 🔬 Event bus (architectural)
- 🔬 Post-exploitation (intrusive)

---

## Deployment Recommendation

### Current: Development/Testing
```bash
# Safe for:
- Internal security research
- Lab testing
- Development
- Learning/training

# NOT for:
- Production systems
- Customer-facing services
- Compliance-critical operations
```

### After Requirements Met: Beta Production
```bash
# Safe for:
- Staging environments
- Controlled penetration tests
- Internal pentest services

# With caution:
- Limited production use
- Non-critical targets
- Continuous monitoring required
```

### After Full Maturity: Production
```bash
# Safe for:
- Enterprise deployment
- SaaS offerings
- Compliance-regulated environments
- Production security testing
```

## Roadmap to Production

| Phase | Timeline | Milestones |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Alpha** | Current | Core features working |
| **Beta** | 2-3 months | Performance tested, audited |
| **RC1** | 4-5 months | Production deployment guide |
| **v1.1.0** | 6+ months | Full production support |

## Questions Before Deployment?

- Is your use case in the **Stable** or **Beta** category?
- Have you read the **SECURITY.md** policy?
- Do you have incident response procedures?
- Can you monitor system performance?
- Is this authorized testing?

**If unsure, start with internal testing first.**
