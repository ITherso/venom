//! Stable data and execution contracts shared by scanner components.
//!
//! ## Runtime scope
//!
//! - **Build:** non-default `legacy-scanner` feature.
//! - **Execution:** Surface A contract used by the historical `ScanRunner`.
//! - **Default `venom scan`:** no.
//! - **Support:** legacy alpha.
//!
//! See `docs/internals/runtime-map.md`.

/// Minimal execution contract understood by the scan runner.
///
/// Implementations contain detection logic only. Scheduling, cancellation,
/// event publication, and aggregation remain runner responsibilities.
///
/// Implementations must structurally own any child work they start. Dropping
/// the future returned by [`ScanPhase::execute`] must stop its child requests
/// and shared-state mutations; detached tasks violate this contract. The
/// runner structurally owns and can drop only the outer `execute` future. Its
/// panic boundary likewise covers only panics that unwind while polling that
/// future, not detached work or `panic = "abort"` builds.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use async_trait::async_trait;
/// use venom_scanner::{Result, ScanContext, ScanFinding, ScanPhase};
///
/// struct HeaderPhase;
///
/// #[async_trait]
/// impl ScanPhase for HeaderPhase {
///     fn phase_number(&self) -> u8 { 10 }
///     fn name(&self) -> &'static str { "header-check" }
///
///     async fn execute(&self, _ctx: &ScanContext) -> Result<Vec<ScanFinding>> {
///         Ok(Vec::new())
///     }
/// }
/// ```
