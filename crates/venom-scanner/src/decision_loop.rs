//! Deterministic orchestration across reasoning, planning, verification, adaptation, and experience.
//!
//! ## Runtime scope
//!
//! - **Build:** default via `scanning`.
//! - **Execution:** Surface B (deterministic decision runtime).
//! - **Default `venom scan`:** yes, through `StandardWebDecisionRuntime`.
//! - **Support:** implemented and tested.
//!
//! See `docs/internals/runtime-map.md`.
//!
//! The decision loop is a state machine, not an executor. It mutates only the
//! knowledge, adaptive ledger, and experience records supplied by the host.
//! Network traffic, plugin execution, delays, and cancellation remain runner
//! responsibilities represented by explicit [`DecisionLoopCommand`] values.
