//! Runner boundary for executing deterministic decision-loop commands.
//!
//! ## Runtime scope
//!
//! - **Build:** default via `scanning`.
//! - **Execution:** Surface B (deterministic decision runtime).
//! - **Default `venom scan`:** yes, through `StandardWebDecisionRuntime`.
//! - **Support:** implemented and tested.
//!
//! See `docs/internals/runtime-map.md`.
//!
//! The decision loop chooses an action; this module resolves its executor,
//! honors scheduler delays, records native evidence, and submits the resulting
//! snapshot to the correct verifier. Executors never receive the knowledge
//! base or decision policy, so plugins cannot bypass provenance checks or
//! mutate reasoning state directly.
