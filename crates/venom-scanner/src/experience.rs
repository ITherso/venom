//! Deterministic experience derived from verification outcomes.
//!
//! ## Runtime scope
//!
//! - **Build:** always/default.
//! - **Execution:** Surface B (deterministic decision runtime).
//! - **Default `venom scan`:** yes, through `StandardWebDecisionRuntime`.
//! - **Support:** implemented and tested.
//!
//! See `docs/internals/runtime-map.md`.
//!
//! The store records immutable outcomes and turns repeated, subject-scoped,
//! suppression-eligible negatives into explainable action recommendations.
//! Target blocks, policy blocks, operational failures, and inconclusive
//! verification remain visible without being treated as proof that an action
//! has no utility. The store does not execute an action, mutate knowledge, or
//! make planner and adaptive policy depend on its internal representation.
