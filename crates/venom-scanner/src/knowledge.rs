//! Thread-safe in-memory knowledge base for evidence-driven reasoning.
//!
//! ## Runtime scope
//!
//! - **Build:** always/default.
//! - **Execution:** `ScanContext` constructs and privately owns a `KnowledgeBase`
//!   on Surface A, but the current legacy phases do not consume it (construction
//!   is not active use); Surface B actively uses it as deterministic reasoning
//!   state.
//! - **Default `venom scan`:** no (constructed but not consumed by the phases).
//! - **Support:** implemented and tested.
//!
//! See `docs/internals/runtime-map.md`.
//!
//! The base owns ontology, instance relationships, evidence, facts, and
//! hypotheses, but deliberately contains no detection, scoring, planning, or
//! persistence behavior. Producers can write observations in any order;
//! referential integrity is therefore eventual so discovery modules remain
//! independent from one another.
