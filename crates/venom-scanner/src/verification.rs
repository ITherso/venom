//! Deterministic passive and active verification.
//!
//! ## Runtime scope
//!
//! - **Build:** always/default.
//! - **Execution:** Surface B (deterministic decision runtime).
//! - **Default `venom scan`:** yes, through `StandardWebDecisionRuntime`.
//! - **Support:** implemented and tested.
//!
//! See `docs/internals/runtime-map.md`.
//!
//! Verifiers consume immutable knowledge snapshots and never execute probes.
//! Passive rules may use existing evidence. Active rules are eligible only
//! when their expression cites evidence added after the passive snapshot, so
//! probe execution remains an explicit boundary outside the decision engine.
