//! Transport-neutral semantic action identities for standard web profiles.
//!
//! ## Runtime scope
//!
//! - **Build:** always/default.
//! - **Execution:** Surface B (deterministic decision runtime).
//! - **Default `venom scan`:** yes, through `StandardWebDecisionRuntime`.
//! - **Support:** implemented and tested.
//!
//! See `docs/internals/runtime-map.md`.
//!
//! Planning, verification, and execution consume this catalog as sibling
//! layers. The catalog defines stable meaning and routing identities but owns
//! no HTTP method, client, executor, or runtime policy.
