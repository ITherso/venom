# Distribution and installation

The remediated, unreleased `0.10.0-alpha.1` source state is currently available from the
repository only. It has no matching prebuilt release artifact, package-manager
repository, container registry, cloud marketplace, or orchestrated deployment
channel.

> Venom is not production-ready. Review and pin the source commit, read the
> [runtime map](internals/runtime-map.md), and use the resulting binary only
> against systems you own or are explicitly authorized to test.

## Build from source

Requirements: Rust 1.88 or newer and Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ITherso/venom.git
cd venom
REVIEWED_COMMIT="REPLACE_WITH_THE_REVIEWED_FULL_COMMIT_SHA"
test "$REVIEWED_COMMIT" != "REPLACE_WITH_THE_REVIEWED_FULL_COMMIT_SHA"
git checkout --detach "$REVIEWED_COMMIT"
test "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" = "$REVIEWED_COMMIT"
cargo build --locked --release -p venom-cli
./target/release/venom --help
```

On Windows, the binary is `target\release\venom.exe`.

PostgreSQL, Redis, Node.js, a dashboard, and an API service are not required by the CLI scan commands.

## Release status

The historical `v0.9.0-alpha` release predates the deterministic-default and
legacy-authority remediation in this repository state. Its binary runs a
different, unsafe historical contract and is not a supported installation path
for the behavior documented here. The repository-root installer was removed so
it cannot silently substitute that artifact for the current source.

A future remediated tag must use the archive, checksum, and provenance contract
in [Release Process](RELEASE.md). Until that tag exists, build a reviewed,
pinned commit from source and do not describe any historical archive as the
current product.

## Local container build

The repository Dockerfile is built in CI and can package the current CLI locally:

```bash
docker build -t venom:local .
docker run --rm venom:local --help
```

The image's default command is `venom --help`; it does not open a listener or contact a target. Pass an explicit deterministic `scan` command and an authorized reachable origin when using the image for an assessment. The non-default API and proxy adapters are not compiled into this image.

Repository workflows do not publish a supported image to Docker Hub or GHCR,
and no `latest`, `slim`, or `full` image contract is promised. A maintainer may
manually build and optionally publish a commit-scoped development image; that
manual artifact is not an installation channel or a release image.

## Unsupported channels

The following installation/deployment claims are **not** supported for this source state:

- Homebrew, Apt/PPA, Pacman/AUR, Snap, Chocolatey, Scoop, or crates.io packages;
- `get.venom.dev` quick-install scripts;
- Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry images;
- Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, Docker Compose, or a PostgreSQL/Redis service stack;
- AWS, Azure, or GCP marketplace images;
- automatic update checks or signed release binaries.

The historical root `docker-compose.yml` was removed. It coupled the CLI to
unused PostgreSQL/Redis services, default credentials, disabled security, and a
listener the default image did not provide. The architecture gate rejects a
replacement root Compose manifest while deployment status remains unsupported.
There is no supported repository installer until a remediated release exists.

The non-deployable [deployment blueprint](experimental/deployment-blueprint.md) records prerequisites that must exist before orchestrated manifests can become executable product artifacts.

## Verify the source-built binary

```bash
venom --version
venom --help
venom scan --help
```

The supported CLI truth is documented in [Getting Started](GETTING_STARTED.md). `venom scan` is the bounded deterministic Preview, while `decision-scan` is its deprecated compatibility alias. The mixed-authority `legacy-scan` (whose complete run remains `Unmetered`), unsupported `api`, and experimental `proxy` adapters are absent from default builds and require explicit Cargo features.
