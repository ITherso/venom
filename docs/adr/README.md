# Architecture decision records

Architecture decision records (ADRs) preserve why a durable technical choice was made. They complement the current-state [architecture guide](../architecture.md), which describes what exists now.

## Index

| [0018](0018-bound-legacy-verification-authority.md) | Accepted | Bound legacy verification behind a separate active authority |
| [0019](0019-host-own-plugin-execution.md) | Accepted | Make plugin execution host-owned and evidence-only |
| [0020](0020-quarantine-platform-and-distribution-surfaces.md) | Accepted; reporting clause superseded by 0021, Lua/distributed clauses by 0022 | Quarantine platform and distribution surfaces |
| [0021](0021-render-bounded-run-reports.md) | Accepted | Render bounded typed run reports without adding verdict authority |
| [0022](0022-bound-host-lua-and-distributed-execution.md) | Accepted | Bound host-owned Lua execution and process-local coordination |

## Format

New records use the next four-digit number and contain: Status, Context, Decision, Consequences, and Alternatives considered. Accepted ADRs are immutable; supersede one with a new ADR instead of rewriting history.
