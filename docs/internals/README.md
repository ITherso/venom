# Internals

These notes explain the implementation boundaries that contributors most often need before changing execution code. They describe the current alpha behavior, including limitations; they are not promises of a stable internal API.

```

- [Scheduler](scheduler.md): explicit-time revisioned queue/worker assignment,
  logical ownership, retry/recovery, and bounded result-retention boundaries.
- [Lua execution](../lua.md): approved-root source snapshots, private VM host
  API, cooperative budgets/cancellation, and receipt/provenance limits.
- [Event bus](event-bus.md): synchronous publication, subscriptions, history, and correlation.
- [Runner](runner.md): ordered phase execution, timeouts, cancellation, and partial results.
- [Decision runner](decision-runner.md): command execution, executor routing, evidence provenance, and verifier handoff.
- [Declarative policy wire contracts](declarative-policy-wire.md): fail-closed semantic fields, compatibility guards, and host loader limits.
- [HTTP evidence executor](http-evidence.md): scope policy, bounded collection, typed observations, and rate-limit normalization.
- [API predicate vocabulary](api-predicates.md): canonical and normalized HTTP/API predicates plus atomic evidence/resource-scope observation bundles.
- [API visibility evidence](api-evidence.md): bounded JSON comparison, broker-backed authorization-context pairs, atomic ingestion receipts, and resource-scoped review projections.
- [API reasoning](api-reasoning.md): deterministic JSON/GraphQL fingerprinting, capped API evidence contributions, and review-only visibility-boundary hypotheses.
- [Standard web decision profile](web-decision.md): one-shot composition, installation transaction, and layer boundaries.
- [Standard web decision runtime](web-runtime.md): target builder, bootstrap evidence, executable-plan filtering, resource budgets, and complete session driving.
- [Web reasoning](web-reasoning.md): standard ontology, explainable fingerprint rules, and Bayesian weak/strong hypotheses.
- [Web planning](web-planning.md): hypothesis-gated actions, utility ranking, policy exclusions, and executor contracts.
- [Payload strategies](payload-strategies.md): planner-selected revisions, deterministic derivation contract, redaction, and transport requirements.
- [Web execution](web-execution.md): semantic executor installation, discovery-only HTTP methods, and scope controls.
- [Web verification](web-verification.md): action/case isolation, passive/active rules, and conservative outcomes.
- [Plugin registry](plugin-registry.md): host-owned scope, request/evidence budgets, redaction, validation, execution, and accounting.
- [Semantic producer contract](semantic-producer-contract.md): production evidence vocabulary compatibility for semantic entity extraction and explicit deferred gaps.

Cross-boundary changes should start in [Architecture Decisions](../adr/README.md). Public contract changes must also follow the [Plugin API policy](../plugin-api-policy.md).
