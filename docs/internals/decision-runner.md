# Decision runner internals

`DecisionLoop` is deterministic policy; `DecisionRunnerAdapter` is the side-effect boundary that executes its commands. Keeping those responsibilities separate makes the same evidence and session state replay to the same decision without requiring a network or plugin runtime in reasoning tests.

The adapter accepts only commands emitted by the decision loop. It never selects an attack, changes utility, evaluates a rule, or invents a retry.

## Executor resolution

Planner commands, registered `ScheduleAction` commands, and retries name the exact executor declared by the currently authorized `PlanStep`. Active probes carry the outstanding case identity and resolve a stage-specific route, allowing verification to use a stricter probe without changing the planner-pinned passive executor.

Duplicate executor IDs and ambiguous action routes are rejected. Missing routes fail before delay or executor work begins.

## Evidence boundary

An executor returns native `Evidence`, not findings or decisions. Before any write, every item must satisfy three provenance invariants:

1. the evidence subject equals the verification case subject;
2. the source component equals the resolved executor ID;
3. the source correlation ID equals the verification case ID.

`KnowledgeBase::insert_evidence_batch` preflights identities under one write lock. A conflict rejects the whole batch, while exact repeats remain idempotent. Active execution captures a subject snapshot immediately before the probe and another after the batch commit.

`DecisionEvidenceReceipt` retains the exact evidence emitted by that execution in addition to the write results and verification snapshots. Its `write_set()` iterator pairs each observation with its input-order `KnowledgeWrite`, making the atomic commit set explicit. This matters for active verification, where passive and active requests intentionally reuse one case correlation ID: resource accounting reads the exact batch rather than double-counting the cumulative subject snapshot.

The host may attach `DecisionExecutionLimits` to reduce executor resource use. Unrestricted requests preserve the existing serialized request shape. The runner exposes execution/commit and decision resumption as separate internal stages so a runtime can account for a committed receipt before verification or experience transition begins.

## Adaptive execution authority

`AdaptivePipeline` proposes control flow; it does not create executor authority. Before `DecisionLoop` turns `ScheduleAction` into an execution command, the action must be registered and pass the same current suppression, requirement, risk, confidence, verification-target, minimum-utility, and budget checks as normal planning. Direct adaptive dispatch rejects actions with prerequisites because the session has no proof that their dependency order already ran. The resulting case uses the authorized action's own motivation and `VerificationTarget`; it never inherits another case's claim permission.

Every adaptive directive that continues automated work (`ScheduleAction`, retry, active verification, or replan) requires an explicit current host-suppression context, even when that set is empty. Context-free submission succeeds only for terminal completion, human review, or halt and otherwise fails atomically. Hosts that planned with `plan_next_with_suppressed_actions` must resume and drive commands with the matching suppression-aware APIs. The high-level runner rejects a missing context and any newly suppressed outstanding action before executor work; its low-level execution API remains an explicit host-owned boundary.

Replay must re-supply current host policy; host executor availability and operator policy deliberately do not become untrusted `DecisionSession` wire state. Outstanding actions must still be registered. A replayed case may preserve a more conservative no-transition policy and its issued payload strategy, but a transition-authorized case must remain within the registered action's currently resolved claim target. This preserves issued-case pinning without letting replay broaden KnowledgeOnly or Distinct authority.

Verifier rules may additionally opt into an action identity and current-case evidence correlation. This is required when a long-lived subject snapshot can contain responses from multiple semantic actions or retries; unrelated and historical observations remain visible to the knowledge base but cannot win that scoped verification rule.

## Plugin observation bridge

`PluginDecisionExecutor` adapts one Preview `PluginRegistry` entry to the decision runner without converting plugin execution into a finding. A host-owned `PluginExecutionRequestProvider` derives a capability-bound `PluginExecutionRequest` from the complete immutable `DecisionExecutionRequest`; an action ID is neither plugin input nor an authorization grant. The adapter rejects a request whose subject or case correlation differs from the outstanding decision case before registry execution.

The plugin recorder returns already normalized native `Evidence`. The adapter forwards that evidence through the runner's ordinary source, subject, and correlation checks before the atomic knowledge write. Successful execution therefore means only that the plugin call completed and its observations were accepted; it does not create a finding, a hypothesis transition, or a verifier outcome. Plugin or request-provider failures remain executor failures and stage no evidence.

## Failure semantics

- A stale command/session mismatch is rejected before executor work.
- Executor and provenance failures leave knowledge unchanged. An executor-reported failure is classified as `NotApplicable`, `BlockedByPolicy`, `TransportFailure`, or `ExecutorFailure`; these are operational audit facts, not verifier outcomes and not automatic Experience suppression inputs.
- `DecisionRunnerError::execution_failure()` exposes an immutable pre-commit receipt containing the exact `DecisionExecutionRequest`, resolved executor identity, normalized diagnostic, and typed failure kind. The request preserves case/action, passive or active stage, origin, scheduler delay, and host-owned limits. A broker-owned dispatch refusal additionally carries its structured `RuntimeLimitExceeded`; the standard runtime converts that expected exhaustion into an auditable halt report. Route lookup, provenance rejection, knowledge storage, and host wall-time failures remain distinct and do not manufacture this receipt.
- Evidence identity conflicts reject the complete batch.
- Once valid observations are committed, they remain immutable even if later verification or adaptive evaluation fails; observations are facts about execution, not a transaction over decision policy. `DecisionRunnerError::committed_evidence()` exposes that durable receipt, and `into_committed_evidence()` transfers it without cloning.
- A successful `DecisionOutcomeReport` is the outcome phase's completion receipt. Its verification, hypothesis write, experience write, and runtime-only `DecisionSessionTransition` describe the state changes applied after evidence storage. The lightweight transition summary is intentionally omitted from the report's existing serialized shape; a future persisted audit format will be explicit and versioned.
- The outcome phase uses candidate experience and session state. On a normal returned error, hypothesis, experience, and session changes are not committed. This is error-atomic, not a claim of crash-atomic persistence.
- Planning also prepares every session mutation on a candidate clone. A planner or case-construction error therefore leaves the replayable session unchanged, including the action-cycle-limit path. Before the swap, the loop validates the subject/ontology revisions and holds the knowledge read lock through the short session commit. Concurrent knowledge writes therefore produce `StalePlanningSnapshot` instead of scheduling an action from stale hypotheses. Successful `DecisionPlanningReport` values expose the before/after `DecisionSessionTransition` without changing their existing serialized shape.
- Rule application intentionally precedes utility planning. If it inserts or updates hypotheses and a later planning step fails, those in-memory knowledge writes remain committed. `DecisionLoopError::committed_reasoning()` returns a `DecisionReasoningCommitReceipt` containing the exact application/write statuses and the subject/ontology revisions of the attempted planner snapshot. Rule evaluations remain pre-commit candidates; consumers should query current knowledge when verifier-owned terminal-state preservation matters. `DecisionRunnerError` forwards the same receipt; absence means that failed planning did not change reasoning state.
- Terminal commands perform no executor work and are returned to the host unchanged.
