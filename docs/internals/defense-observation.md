# Defense observation

The `defense` module is an **observation-only** layer. It turns raw response
signals into a typed, bounded picture of a target's defensive behavior. It never
selects a payload or an evasion technique — that decision belongs to the planner,
which consumes these observations. Keeping detection and payload selection in
separate modules means a change to a defensive fingerprint can never silently
change attack behavior.

The former legacy `waf` detector/evasion utility has been removed. Payload
derivation lives behind the bounded `payload_strategies` contract.

## Fingerprinting

`defense::fingerprint` infers the most likely defensive product from response
signals. Matching is deliberately robust:

- header **names** are matched case-insensitively;
- header and body **values** are matched by case-insensitive substring, not exact
  equality, so a brittle `"Server: cloudflare"` equality check is replaced by a
  `server` value containing `cloudflare`;
- `set-cookie` signatures match any cookie value, so session-cookie tells (for
  example `BIGipServer*`, `incap_ses*`) are detected regardless of the rest of
  the header.

Each match carries a `FingerprintConfidence` of `Weak`, `Probable`, or `Strong`,
and the strongest match wins deterministically. AWS signals are intentionally
conservative: an Amazon request id or S3 server banner indicates Amazon
infrastructure, not necessarily a WAF, so the brittle legacy `Server: AmazonS3`
→ AWS WAF inference is dropped in favor of confidence-graded signals. The body is
scanned only up to a fixed byte ceiling, so a large response cannot turn one
observation into unbounded work.

## Defense state

`DefenseState::observe(status, headers, body)` projects one response into a
bounded, deterministic observation:

- `DefenseStatusSignal` — a coarse status class (`Forbidden`, `NotAcceptable`,
  `Teapot`, `RateLimited`, `ServerError`, or `Normal`);
- challenge markers found in the (bounded) body prefix;
- rate-limit signals, from a `429` status or rate-limit accounting headers;
- an optional product fingerprint;
- an overall `DefensePosture` of `Open`, `Suspected`, or `Blocking`.

Posture derivation is conservative and separates deliberate blocks from ambiguous
conditions: a `403`/`406`/`418` status or a challenge body is `Blocking`; rate
limiting or a product fingerprint alone is only `Suspected`; a `5xx` on its own is
not treated as a block. The observation makes no payload or escalation decision;
it is the evidence a planner would weigh before choosing a strategy.

## Defense transitions

`DefenseTransition::between(control, candidate)` is the deterministic difference
between two observations of the same target — typically a baseline (control)
response and a response to a strategy-derived candidate request. It reports:

- a `PostureShift` of `Escalated`, `Deescalated`, or `Unchanged`, derived from
  the ordered postures;
- whether the candidate became newly blocking or newly rate limited;
- whether the coarse status class or the fingerprinted product changed;
- a `DefenseTransitionKind` summary of `NoChange`, `DefenseEngaged`,
  `DefenseRelaxed`, or `DefenseReconfigured` (same posture level, different
  signals).

A transition is evidence, not a decision. It is the signal a planner would weigh
to decide whether to escalate to a different payload strategy, back off, or
re-fingerprint — the escalation policy itself is a separate, later step.

## Escalation policy

`defense::policy::recommend(state, transition)` is the single place that turns
observation into a recommendation. It maps a `DefenseState` and an optional
`DefenseTransition` into a `DefenseResponse`:

- `Proceed` — no defensive reaction;
- `Observe` — defensive infrastructure present but not blocking;
- `Backoff` — rate limiting is in effect;
- `Reconsider` — the candidate provoked a block the control did not, so the block
  is attributed to the candidate request and the planner should change strategy;
- `Halt` — a standing hard block or challenge.

`DefenseResponse` is ordered by restrictiveness, so a caller weighing several
observations can take the maximum. The policy recommends but never acts: it
selects no payload and issues no request. Wiring the recommendation into planner
strategy selection is the next, separate step.

## Evidence projection

`defense::projection` adapts the observation contracts above into immutable
`venom_core::Evidence` a knowledge store can retain with full provenance. It is
strictly projection-only:

- `project_defense_state` / `project_defense_transition` return `Vec<Evidence>`;
  `project_outcome` handles an `ObservedOutcome`, returning an empty vector for
  `NoResponse` so a timeout or connection failure is **never** learned as a
  defensive signal.
- It emits **observations only** — never a `Fact` or hypothesis — so a single
  block never becomes a "confirmed WAF" claim, and a bare block with no matching
  fingerprint yields no product predicate.
- Predicates are namespaced under `defense.*` — for example
  `defense.posture.blocking`, `defense.status.blocked`,
  `defense.challenge.present`, `defense.rate_limit.observed`,
  `defense.fingerprint.cloudflare`, and `defense.transition.engaged`.
- Each record carries its producer (`EvidenceSource` component), the resource
  (`subject`), and the case/action correlation in their dedicated fields, and —
  for a fingerprint — the fingerprint confidence as the record reliability. The
  evidence id is `defense/<sha256>` over a versioned, length-framed canonical
  identity (producer, resource, correlation, sequence, response receipt,
  predicate, timestamp), so the observation sequence and receipt bind the record
  without the raw resource, receipt, correlation, or producer ever appearing in
  an id that reaches reports, JSON, or logs.
- Identity and timestamp come from a caller-supplied
  `DefenseObservationContext`, so the projection is a pure, deterministic,
  idempotent function. It reads no clock or randomness, selects no payload,
  issues no request, and touches neither the planner nor the executor.

Callers ingest the result through the existing
`KnowledgeBase::insert_evidence_batch`. Reading these predicates during planning
is a separate, later step behind a default-off flag.

## Defense-aware shadow planning

`defense::shadow_planning` shows how the current plan *would* change under an
observed defensive posture, without changing anything. `defense_aware_shadow_plan`
computes the current plan and a second, read-only shadow plan through the
planner's pure `plan_snapshot_with_suppressed` seam, plus an explainable delta.
It issues no request and mutates no planner, runtime, knowledge, or experience
state, and never reorders the real plan.

- Defense evidence is not a second planner: it never adds an action and never
  raises an action's utility. For each existing candidate it only `Allow`s,
  `Deprioritize`s, or `Suppress`es, through a single monotonic mapping keyed on
  the `DefenseResponse` and a typed `DefenseInteractionClass` (`LocalOnly`,
  `Passive`, `Behavioral`, `DifferentialRead`, `ActiveVerification`, `Mutating`).
  Classification is supplied by the host as typed metadata, never by string
  matching on action ids.
- The mapping is monotonic and preserves local work: `Proceed` changes nothing;
  `Observe` only deprioritizes active/mutating work; `Backoff` suppresses active
  verification and mutation while keeping passive and local analysis; `Reconsider`
  suppresses active work and deprioritizes behavioral/differential work; `Halt`
  suppresses every network-producing action while keeping local analysis, audit,
  reporting, and human-review actions.
- Recommendations come from the existing `defense::policy::recommend`, aggregated
  per resource by `ResourceDefenseSignal::aggregate`. Aggregation is
  order-independent and corroborated: a single standing block is downgraded (an
  uncorroborated `Halt` becomes `Observe`), while rate-limit `Backoff` and
  transition-driven `Reconsider` are self-corroborated.
- A signal applies only to its own resource (exact-resource scope): a block seen
  on one endpoint never changes another endpoint's plan.
- The `ShadowPlanDelta` carries `unchanged`, `deprioritized`, and `suppressed`
  actions, each with its interaction class, the driving recommendation, the
  supporting evidence ids, and a stable explanation code (rendered by
  `render_explanation`) rather than free text.

This layer has no configuration flag: reading the delta is advisory only.
Enforcement behind a default-off flag is a separate, later step.

## Enforcement (default off)

`defense::enforcement` is the only place defense evidence changes the *real*
plan, and only when explicitly enabled. `DefensePlanningPolicy` is off by
default — enabling it is a per-release decision.

- `defense_aware_plan` reuses the shadow layer to decide what to suppress, then
  applies those suppressions to the planner through the distinct
  `ExclusionReason::DefenseSuppressed` path, so a defense suppression never
  conflates with an adaptive or operator `PolicySuppressed`.
- While disabled, the result is byte-for-byte the plan the planner produces with
  no defense influence — proven by `disabled_flag_preserves_existing_plan_byte_for_byte`.
- A defense-suppressed action is excluded, so it never becomes a plan step and
  never reaches an executor (`policy_denied_strategy_never_reaches_a_plan_step`).
- Defense still never adds an action or raises utility; it can only remove
  suppressed candidates. Numeric utility penalties (a graded, non-binary
  suppression) are deliberately deferred to a later release.

`ExclusionReason::DefenseSuppressed` keeps defense suppression distinct from
policy suppression, transport failures, and other outcomes, so downstream
learning never gives them the same weight.

## Boundaries

`DefenseState::observe` is a pure function of its inputs: identical
`(status, headers, body)` always yield an equal `DefenseState`. The module reads
no clock, randomness, knowledge, or transport, and issues no request. It is the
observation half of the split the WAF sprint introduces; escalation policy and a
planner that selects a payload strategy from this evidence are separate, later
steps.
