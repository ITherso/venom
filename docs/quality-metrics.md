# Quality metrics

Venom publishes measurements as CI artifacts instead of embedding hand-maintained numbers in the README.

Evidence-backed release baselines are committed under `docs/reports/benchmarks/`. The latest published record is [commit `f7d5120`](reports/benchmarks/f7d5120.md), with raw values in [JSON](reports/benchmarks/f7d5120.json).

## Every push and pull request

The `Quality Metrics` workflow records:

- release compile wall time;
- release binary size;
- build peak resident memory;
- Criterion suite wall time and peak resident memory;
- detailed Cargo timing and Criterion reports;
- commit SHA and Rust compiler version.

Results are runner-local regression signals. They are not comparable across arbitrary hardware and are not endpoint-capacity claims.

Coverage is produced by the Tests workflow with measurement Rust `1.88.0`, its
`llvm-tools-preview` component, and the explicit LLVM backend of
`cargo-tarpaulin 0.37.2`, compiled by pinned installer Rust `1.91.0`. The
workflow uploads Cobertura plus deterministic JSON and Markdown summaries as a
retained artifact. Evidence schema `venom.coverage.v2` records a normalized
line-state digest in addition to aggregate and per-file counts, so a same-count
covered-line swap cannot pass the baseline-acceptance seal. It attempts a
best-effort advisory Codecov upload, but tokenless availability is not required
or enforced.
The fixed scope is tracked Rust files under `crates/*/src/**` plus `xtask/src/**`;
Tarpaulin is instructed to ignore test functions with `--ignore-tests`.
Unit, integration, compatibility, and security results remain separate checks.

The accepted [LLVM coverage record](reports/coverage/6edc4d925739.md) establishes
an exact aggregate and changed-line floor of 21,439/24,842 observed coverable
source lines. The repository checker validates safe paths, integer counts,
report structure, and base-to-head diff structure, and it emits an explicit
patch row for every changed in-scope file. The accepted omission inventory is
the reviewed nine-path list. An omission is excluded from the patch denominator
only while its path and source blob remain frozen to the applicable floor
record; changed content
must become measured. New omissions fail closed, as does disappearance from
Cobertura of a source measured in the applicable accepted baseline and still
present at HEAD. The checker also rejects production-source
`tarpaulin`/`tarpaulin_*` cfg,
`coverage(off)`, and legacy `no_coverage` instrumentation exclusions. The exact
command ignores Tarpaulin config and fixes the LLVM backend, while architecture
pins workflow env and Cargo config and forbids custom build targets. It emits
the evidence needed to review a replacement baseline. Calibration cannot run
while the accepted pointer exists. See
[Coverage evidence](reports/coverage/README.md) for the accepted record,
replacement procedure, and exact floor and patch policy.

`scripts/generate-metrics.sh` derives package roots from locked Cargo metadata,
then reports only Rust files that Git identifies as tracked below those roots.
The architecture gate separately rejects loose top-level Rust files in the
examples package that are not declared Cargo targets. These repository-size
counts are not a coverage or quality score. Running the script requires Bash,
Git, Cargo, and Python 3 for decoding Cargo's JSON output.

## Scoped mutation evidence

Mutation testing is used as a review technique for selected semantic contracts,
not as a permanent repository-wide score. Recent hardening work used pinned
`cargo-mutants` campaigns around declarative policy, planner/runtime authority,
and HTML extraction boundaries in [PR #53](https://github.com/ITherso/venom/pull/53),
[PR #54](https://github.com/ITherso/venom/pull/54), and
[PR #55](https://github.com/ITherso/venom/pull/55). Viable survivors were
classified by behavior; serious semantic gaps became focused deterministic
regressions and were rerun in narrowed campaigns.

Those pull-request records are scoped evidence for their exact revisions. Venom
does not have a committed mutation workflow, an aggregate workspace score, or a
claim that every mutation-relevant function has been exercised.

## Not measured yet

| Metric | State | Exit criterion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project-wide mutation baseline | Missing | Commit a repeatable scope, exclusions, survivor policy, and comparable baseline |
| Endpoint throughput/latency | Missing | Controlled fixture at 100, 1,000, and 10,000 request scales |
| Scanner peak RAM/CPU | Missing | End-to-end workload with pinned hardware and feature flags |
| External audit findings | Missing | Independent scope, report, and remediation record |

If a permanent mutation job is introduced, it should normally run on a schedule
rather than every push because it executes many modified test builds. Scoped
campaign evidence must not be represented as complete mutation coverage.

## Reproduce microbenchmarks

```bash
cargo bench -p venom-scanner --bench scanner_benchmarks
```
