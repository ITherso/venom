# Scanner

`venom-scanner` contains the default deterministic evidence/reasoning/runtime stack plus feature-gated historical scan contracts, optional analysis modules, plugins, events, persistence models, and bounded report rendering.

## Default deterministic runtime

Default builds expose `venom scan`, which composes `StandardWebDecisionRuntime` with a fixed bounded profile. Its network actions use the runtime's redirect-disabled metered broker, and its output consists of operational decisions and verifier outcomes rather than findings.

## Historical ordered pipeline

The ordered runner, scanner SDK, context, and phases require the non-default
`legacy-scanner` feature. The CLI exposes them only as `legacy-scan`, and only
after `--acknowledge-legacy-heuristics`. It registers reconnaissance, crawling,
parameter discovery, SQL-behavior observation, reflection observation,
template-arithmetic observation, an inert-by-default file-canary/XXE phase, and
an inert-by-default OOB delivery phase;
`DirectoryFuzzer` requires the additional `--legacy-directory-fuzz` opt-in.

This is currently a mixed-authority pipeline:

- Crawler, optional directory discovery, and parameter discovery (phases two
  through four) share a context-owned exact-origin, redirect-disabled broker.
  `DiscoveryLimits` configures finite crawl-depth, page, request,
  per-request-timeout, wall-time, cumulative-body, and per-response-body
  ceilings across those phases.
- The crawler uses deterministic breadth-first traversal and an HTML5 parser
  only for complete `text/html` bodies no larger than 64 KiB. Its typed forms retain action, method,
  and named parser-tree-descendant controls. POST and dialog forms are recorded,
  never requested as GET.
- Directory discovery compares candidates to two stable randomized
  nonexistent-path controls in the same parent namespace and with the same
  trailing-slash and extension shape. Parameter discovery requires a
  reproducible four-leg differential:
  baseline, randomized unknown parameter, candidate, and identical replay.
  Both produce `INFO` observations, not vulnerability conclusions.
- Discovery endpoints, visits, and forms are staged and committed atomically;
  a failed or budget-exhausted batch does not publish partial state.
- Phases five through nine share a second context-owned exact-origin broker.
  `VerificationLimits` configures its finite request, per-request-timeout,
  wall-time, cumulative-body, and per-response-body ceilings. Requests are
  bodyless, redirects and retries are disabled, and broker accounting uses the
  `Active` stage. The default shared request ceiling is 96; phase-local
  ceilings (20/18/16/16/16) prevent one built-in phase from consuming the full
  envelope. This is a separate migration authority, not the standard runtime's
  `RuntimeBudget`.
- Reproduced SQL diagnostics and robust timing differentials, exact replayed
  template arithmetic, and an SDK host's explicitly configured benign
  local-file canary may project only verifier-owned, knowledge-only
  `NeedsReview`. Exact nonce reflection remains `Unknown` because there is no
  browser-execution verifier. The default phase-eight path dispatches neither
  LFI nor XXE probes; an OOB string does not enable XXE. Phase nine is inert by
  default, and explicit OOB delivery records a nonce-bearing request receipt,
  not callback evidence. No cloud-metadata or sensitive-file destination is a
  default probe.
- Reconnaissance and host-defined custom phases can still use the raw legacy
  client outside both bounded authorities and `RuntimeBudget`. Consequently the
  complete ordered run is reported as `Unmetered` even though built-in phases
  two through nine have scoped limits.

The CLI emits typed completion state and suppresses phase prose/evidence. Raw
compatibility records project only as informational `Unknown` observations;
the allowlisted phase-five, phase-seven, and opt-in phase-eight bridge can
instead publish the verifier-scoped `NeedsReview` outcomes described above.
See the [runtime map](internals/runtime-map.md),
[ADR 0016](adr/0016-bound-legacy-discovery-authority.md), and
[ADR 0018](adr/0018-bound-legacy-verification-authority.md).

Each phase implements:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait ScanPhase: Send + Sync {
    fn phase_number(&self) -> u8;
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;
    async fn execute(&self, ctx: &ScanContext) -> Result<Vec<ScanFinding>>;
}
```

## Reporting host contract

The independent `reporting` feature exposes a bounded, deterministic renderer
for an already constructed `RunReport`. It enables only `core`, performs no I/O,
and has no repository or default CLI caller. It preserves typed run status,
stop classification code, accounting, and steps, and emits a privacy-minimized
outcome projection without serializing fingerprints/private provenance or
calculating risk, severity, findings, or vulnerability verdicts. Format
encoding is not redaction: a host must
pre-redact `target`, `authorized_origin`, step/outcome `action_id`, and outcome
`redacted_summary` values. See [Bounded run-report rendering](reporting.md) and [ADR
0021](adr/0021-render-bounded-run-reports.md).

## Experimental host execution contracts

The independent `lua` feature closes over `core`, Tokio, and a vendored Lua 5.4
build with no default `mlua` features. It implements approved-root source
snapshot registration and fresh, no-standard-library, text-only VMs with
bounded context/output/return/history and cooperative memory, instruction,
deadline, cancellation, and concurrency controls. These controls are not
process isolation or an OS sandbox; no CLI, scanner phase, or plugin path calls
them. See [Lua execution](lua.md).

The `distributed` feature has an empty raw feature closure and implements bounded ordered
task/worker/result state machines with caller-supplied logical time, expected
revisions, fenced leases, fixed retry/recovery policy, and deterministic output
for a fixed accepted command order. It has no transport, authentication,
serialization, persistence, ambient clock, background work, exactly-once, or
multi-node contract. See [Distributed coordination](distributed.md).

Default builds enable exactly `core` and `scanning`. Detection, the historical
runner, platform models, the bounded report renderer, host execution surfaces,
and the other feature-flagged modules listed above require explicit opt-in. CI
compiles these feature groups independently, and the architecture gate binds
their private module declarations, exact root facades, dependency closures,
and authority constraints to the expected Cargo features. See the [runtime
map](internals/runtime-map.md).

## Adding a phase

1. Implement `ScanPhase` in `src/phases/`.
2. Keep CLI types out of the implementation. A built-in phase must use its
   assigned context-owned transport authority; an external custom phase that
   uses the compatibility client keeps the whole run explicitly `Unmetered`.
3. Return internal compatibility records; do not render or claim findings in
   the phase. The typed SDK boundary projects raw records only as unresolved
   observations. New verifier-backed projections require an explicit,
   allowlisted case and claim policy rather than a severity string.
4. Cover network failures, cancellation, and false-positive boundaries.
5. Register the phase in the composition root only after its ordering is explicit.

## Safety

Phases can send traffic that affects a target. Use bounded concurrency, timeouts, and conservative defaults. Tests that require external targets must use controlled fixtures and must not run against public services.
